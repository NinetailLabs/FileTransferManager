# FileTransferManager NineTail Labs (Unofficial release)
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/FileTransferManager_NineTailLabs.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FileTransferManager_NineTailLabs)

C# lib for copying/moving files and folders with reporting a progress with support for sync and async invocation.
Provides functionality to check access rights for a given folder.

## Note
This is an unofficial release by NineTail Labs to port the library to NetStandard as the original repository no longer seems to be maintained.
The current plan is to release a 1.1.0 version which is fully compatible with the 1.0.6 version of the official library.
The 2.x branch will potentially depart from the 1.x version to suit additional requirements though we might try to keep compatibility if possible.
