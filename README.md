# VaraniumSharp.FileTransferManager
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/VaraniumSharp.FileTransferManager.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VaraniumSharp.FileTransferManager)

C# lib for copying/moving files and folders while reporting progress with support for sync and async invocation.
Provides functionality to check access rights for a given folder.

## Note
This is an unofficial release of the [FileTransferManager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FileTransferManager) by NineTail Labs to port the library to NetStandard as the original repository no longer seems to be maintained.
The current plan is to release a 1.1.0 version which will be fully compatible with the 1.0.6 version of the official library.
The 2.x branch will depart from the 1.x version to better suit our usage requirements.
